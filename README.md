# 💡 Focused Generative AI & LLM Handbook (Concepts & Code)

A concise and practical repository covering the essential theory, algorithms, and application frameworks for building solutions with Large Language Models (LLMs).

This repository is divided into two main sections: **Concepts** (for theoretical knowledge) and **Algorithms** (for practical implementation).
